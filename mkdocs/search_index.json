Like \ntarget=\"_blank\"\n.\n\n\nicon\n Icon Class Code supplied to the \n<i class=\"\">\n. If using font-awesome, use full class code that is to be provided in \n<i>\n, like \nfa fa-code\n.\n\n\ntype\n It is used to distinguish multiple menus. For example there is a Main nav menu and Sidebar Nav Menu. So different names can be alloted to both.\n\n\nauth\nAuthentication Level can be defined here. Here \n1=Authenticated Users Only, 2=Unauthenticated Users Only, 0=Both User Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying the Menu\n\n\nThe menu can be displayed by using the following function:\n\n\nDropmenu::display($type);\n\n\n\n\nThe \n$type\n is the value provided in the \ntype\n column in the database table. For Example: main:nav or sidebar or sidebar:nav or main:foot, etc.\n\n\nSettings Explained\n\n\nSettings are new to Dropmenu released after \n1.5.0+\n. Settings give an enhancement for customizing and supporting of the dropdown menu with maximum number of themes.\n\n\n\n\nSettings can be injected, if mandatory, using \nDropmenu::display($type, $iconSettingArray, $childSettingArray)\n, the second and third parameters.\n\n\n\n\nAvailable Options\n\n\nIcon Settings\n\n\nThese settings are not mandatory by default. They give an extensive support for customizing the dropdown menu. The Icon Settings consits of three customizable attributes:\n- \nprefix\n: \nPrefix is the starting element that are provided before the value of the \nicon\n table. By Default it is set to \n<i class='\n. Further the HTML is completed by the \nSuffix\n. It comes in handy when you need to (for example) add a div element also for the navigation menu then you will set its value to: \n<div class=\"someThing\"><i class=\"\n.\n\n- \nsuffix\n: \nTo complete the HTML Suffix should be provided. Following the above example, the suffix will be: \n\"></i>\n.\n\n- \nline_end\n: \nFollowing the example, Line End to play when you need to end the \n</div>\n element after the Link text ends, else it can be left blank and the \ndiv\n can be ended in the suffix.\n\n\nChild Settings\n\n\nChild Settings are also not mandatory to be set. It's an extensive support option as some themes have different classes for their child menu for different styling. Child Settings currently only have an option to set Unordered List Attributes, for example \nclass=\"\" id=\"\"\n.\n- \nul_attributes\n\n\nInjecting\n\n\nSettings can be injected using the same \ndisplay()\n function of \nDropmenu\n.\n\n\n    // Icon Settings\n    $icon['prefix'] = '<div id=\"navElement1\"><i id=\"someThing\" class=\"';\n    $icon['suffix'] = '\"></i>';\n    $icon['line_end'] = '</div>';\n\n    // Child Settings\n    $child['ul_attributes'] = 'class=\"nav nav_child\"';\n\n    Dropmenu::display('admin:nav', $icon, $child);\n\n\n\n\nSample Output:\n\n\n    <ul class=\"nav nav_parent\">\n        <li>\n            <a href=\"#someLink\">\n                <div id=\"navElement1\">\n                    <i id=\"someThing\" class=\"fa fa-cogs\"></i>Settings\n                </div>\n            </a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n            <ul class=\"nav nav_child\">\n                <li>\n                    <a href=\"#someLink\">\n                        <div id=\"navElement1\">\n                            <i id=\"someThing\" class=\"fa fa-microchip\"></i>Chip Settings\n                        </div>\n                    </a>\n                </li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n    </ul>",
